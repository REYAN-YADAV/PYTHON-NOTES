## 1. What is Language?
> **Definition:**  
A *language* is a systematic method of communication used to exchange ideas, instructions, or information.

### Types of Languages
| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Natural Language** | Used by humans for communication | English, Hindi |
| **Formal Language** | Used by computers; follows strict rules | Python, C, Java |

---

## 2. What is a Program?
> A **program** is a set of instructions written by a programmer to perform a specific task.

### Characteristics
- Follows a sequence  
- Can be executed by a computer  
- Written using any programming language  

---

## 3. Types of Programming Languages
Programming languages are broadly divided into:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Low-Level Languages** | Close to hardware; fast but difficult | Machine Language, Assembly |
| **High-Level Languages** | Easy to understand; closer to English | Python, Java, C++ |
| **Scripting Languages** | Execute scripts; used for automation | Python, JavaScript |
| **Domain-Specific Languages** | Built for specific use cases | SQL, HTML |

---

## 4. Low Level Languages

### a) Machine Language
> **Definition:** Machine language is the lowest-level programming language consisting of binary digits (0s and 1s).

### Example
```
0001 1001 1100
```

### Advantages
- Fastest execution  
- No translator needed  

### Disadvantages
- Hard to read  
- Error-prone  
- Machine-dependent  

---

## 5. Assembly Language
> A symbolic low-level language using mnemonics instead of binary.

### Example
```
MOV A, B
ADD A, 10
```

### Advantages
- Easier than machine language  
- Faster execution  

### Disadvantages
- Still hardware dependent  
- Harder than high-level languages  

### What is an Assembler?
An **assembler** converts assembly code → machine code.

---

## 6. Translators: Interpreter & Compiler
Computers cannot directly understand high-level languages.  
So we use **translators**.

### Types of Translators
| Translator | Works On | Converts To | Style |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Interpreter** | Line-by-line | Machine Code | Finds errors immediately |
| **Compiler** | Whole program | Machine Code | Faster execution |

---

## 7. Tokens
> The smallest unit in a program.

### Types of Tokens
- Keywords  
- Identifiers  
- Operators  
- Literals  
- Punctuators  

---

## 8. Scripting Languages
> Scripting languages are used to automate tasks and execute scripts.

### What is a Script?
A script is a small program written to automate a process.

### Examples
- Python  
- JavaScript  
- Shell Script  

---

## 9. Programming Paradigms
Different styles of writing programs.

| Paradigm | Full Form | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **POP** | Procedure Oriented Programming | Program divided into functions |
| **OOP** | Object Oriented Programming | Uses objects & classes |
| **SOP** | Structured Oriented Programming | Uses blocks, loops, conditions |
| **MOP** | Modular Oriented Programming | Divides program into modules |

---

## 10. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented language.

### Features
- Easy to learn  
- Interpreted  
- Portable  
- Open-source  
- Large standard library  

### Purpose-Based Languages
| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| System Language | Hardware control |
| Application Language | Apps, software |
| Scripting Language | Automation |
